# Banking-App
Inspired by a tutorial, this simple application designed using HTML, CSS, JS allows you deposit and request money between a series of pre-existing accounts.

You can transfer, and request money from pre-existing accounts. Below are the current existing accounts:

##
Name: James May
</br>Username (to Login): **jm**
</br>Password: **1111**
##
Name: Olivia Smith 
</br>Username (to Login): **os**
</br>Password: 2222
##
Name: Stephen James
</br>Username (to Login): **sj**
</br>Password: **3333**
##
Name: Mary Jane
</br>Username (to Login): **lr**
</br>Password: **4444**

**You can only transfer and request between these 4 accounts at the moment. Remember to type in the username (initials) when doing so.**
