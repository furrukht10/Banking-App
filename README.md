# Banking-App
Inspired by a tutorial, this simple application designed using HTML, CSS, JS allows you deposit and request money between a series of pre-existing accounts.

You can transfer, and request money from pre-existing accounts. Below are the current existing accounts:

##You can only transfer and request between these 4 accounts at the moment. Remember to type in the username (initials) when doing so.
